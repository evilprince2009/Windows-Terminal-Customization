Now, let's start customizing the terminal. First things first , let's go through the prerequisites.

### Prerequisites

- [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701#activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
- [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/releases/tag/v2106.17)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Posh Winfetch](https://github.com/evilprince2009/Posh-Winfetch-remake/)

## How to's

### Install Windows Terminal

Definitely if you haven't installed Windows Terminal yet, install it from Microsoft Store. Thats the first thing you need to do.

### Install Cascadia Code

Download the [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/releases/tag/v2106.17) font latest version and install it on your computer. This should be very straight forward. Using other fonts might create gibberish on the terminal and break the design.

### Install Git

Download the [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/downloads) and install and configure it on your system properly. You can check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE&t=762s) to see how to install and configure Git properly on Windows.

### Install Posh Winfetch

Head over to [Posh Winfetch](https://github.com/evilprince2009/Posh-Winfetch-remake/) repo and go through the README , and follow the instructions to install it properly on your system.

### Workspace directory

Make a folder named `Workspace` in your `D:\` Drive.

### Write your custom settings

- Hit `Windows+R` to open the run command.
- Paste `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState` and hit enter. This will bring up a file explorer.
- Now download the `settings.json` file from _[here](https://github.com/evilprince2009/Windows-Terminal-Customization/blob/main/settings.json)_ and paste it in the file explorer.

### Now it's showtime

Restart your Windows Terminal and you should be good to go.
